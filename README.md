TimelapsGit
===========
This awesome small project loads up any file inside a git repository and shows a Time Laps View of that file. It will show the current state of the file together with a slider that you can drag around to vizualize the changes to the file over time. Also each line is colored depending on the _age_ of that line.

Inspiration
